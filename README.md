# Denver Street Art

Take a virtual tour of Denver's amazing street art. Select a region on the map and see the work that can be found there. 

Regions include:

1. RiNo and Five Points
2. Downtown
3. Cherry Creek Trail
4. SantaFe and South Broadway

On each region's page, click each artwork to bring up a more detailed view of each work. 

The 'Admin' area allows an authorized user to add, edit, and delete artwork. In an effort to control the quality of submissions, there is currently no way to add yourself as an authorized user, besides contacting the site creator directly.

## Technology Used

This project uses React JS for the front-end and Firebase Firestore/Storage for the back-end. The map is from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com).

## Future Improvements

Adding a way for a user to suggest edits to each work, probably through a contact form. 

Adding a way for a user to submit work, with all the necessary details, directly to the administrator. The user would still not have direct access to the database.
